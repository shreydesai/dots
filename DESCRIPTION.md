# Description

## Overview

This game is a one player, arcade shooter game. The player is represented by a black circle that must face three enemies throughout the game, characterized by their colors: red, green, and blue. 

The red enemies are static and cannot move, the green enemies move up and down at a medium pace, and the blue enemies move up and down at a faster pace. In order to defeat these enemies, the player can point his/her cursor at the enemies and shoot them. If the bullet touches the enemy, then the enemy will vanish.

The game will be restricted to about a minute and a half of playing time. As the player kills the enemies, he/she will receive points; 5 for red, 10 for green, and 15 for blue. 

This project uses the Java programming language along with HTML and CSS as accessories for design purposes. We are not using GridWorld to construct our graphical user interface, but JavaFX instead.
