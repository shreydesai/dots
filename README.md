# Dots

Dots is an arcade-style shooter game that features a player and enemies. The player is able to shoot small bullets, which have the potential of destroying the enemies. As time goes on, the enemies get tougher and tougher; red enemies cannot move, green enemies move at a medium speed, and blue enemies move at a fast speed. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible in one minute and thirty seconds.
